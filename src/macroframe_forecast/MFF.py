class MFF:
    """A class for Macro-Framework Forecasting (MFF).

    This class facilitates forecasting of single frequency time series data
    using a two-step process. First step of the forecasting procedure generates
    unconstrained forecasts using the forecaster specified. In the next step,
    these forecasts are then reconclied so that they satisfy the supplied
    constrants, and smoothness of the forecasts is maintained.

    Parameters
    ----------
    df : pd.DataFrame
       Input dataframe containing time series data. Data should be in wide
       format, with each row containing data for one period, and each
       column containing data for one variable.

    forecaster : BaseForecaster, optional(default: None)
        sktime BaseForecaster descendant. If not defined, then DefaultForecaster
        is used.

    constraints_with_wildcard : str, optional(default: None)
        Constraints that hold with equality. Constraints may include wildcard,
        in which case constraints will be applied across all horizons, or
        may be defined for specified time periods.

    ineq_constraints_with_wildcard : str, optional(default: None)
        Inequality constraints, comparable to ``constraints_with_wildcard``.
        Constraints may include wildcard, in which case constraints will be
        applied across all horizons, or may be defined for specified time
        periods. Constraints should be written in the form of 'C_ineq*y - d_ineq â‰¤ 0 '. 

    parallelize : boolean
        Indicate whether parallelization should be employed for generating the
        first step forecasts. Default value is `True`.

    n_forecast_error : int
        Number of windows to split data into training and testing sets for
        generating matrix of forecast errors. Default is 5.

    shrinkage_method : str, optional(default: 'oas')
        Method to be used for shrinking sample covariance matrix. Default is
        Oracle Shrinking Approximating Estimator ('oas'). Other options are
        oas, identity and monotone_diagonal.

    default_lam : float, optional(default: -1)
        The value of lambda to be used for calculating smoothing parameter if
        frequency of observations cannot be determined from index names. If this
        is set to -1, lambda is calculated empirically. Default is -1.

    max_lam : float, optional(default: 129600)
        Maximum value of lamstar to be used for smoothing forecasts when being
        estimated empirically.

    Returns
    -------
    df2 : pd.Dataframe
        Output dataframe with all reconciled forecasts filled into the original
        input.
